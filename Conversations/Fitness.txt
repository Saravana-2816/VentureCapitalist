Startup idea:
AI-powered fitness app targeting millennials, focusing on personalized workout plans and real‑time progress tracking.

After evaluating urban millennial trends, the app’s core offering will be hyper‑personalized workout programs that adapt weekly based on user feedback and performance data. Emphasis on social sharing features to tap into network effects.

Product research agent:
Develop adaptive workout algorithms using user metrics (age, fitness level, past injuries). Prototype includes guided video sessions with AI‑driven form correction and built‑in achievement badges. Plan multi‑device support: iOS, Android, web dashboard.

Finance research agent:
Business model blends freemium subscriptions (basic plans free, advanced plans ₹299/month) with in‑app purchases for specialized training modules (₹49–₹199). Projected break‑even within 18 months at 50,000 paid users. Explore partnerships with gyms for revenue share.

Open conversation agent:
Invite the team to brainstorm additional engagement mechanics—leaderboards, friend challenges, live classes—and discuss integration timelines for Apple Watch and Fitbit APIs.
