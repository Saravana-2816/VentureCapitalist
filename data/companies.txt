### Blue Apron
Blue Apron was founded in 2012 premised on a simple desire—our founders wanted to cook at home with their families, but they found grocery shopping and menu planning burdensome, time-consuming, and expensive. Our founders hand-packed the first Blue Apron boxes themselves, delivered them to family and friends, and received immediate positive feedback. Since those initial deliveries, we have scaled rapidly, developing our expertise and an ever-more ambitious vision. We are reimagining the way that food is produced, distributed, and consumed, and as a result, building a better food system that benefits consumers, food producers, and the planet. The nature of our business carries with it unique and exciting challenges, and our employees working across our fives offices, take on these complexities to ensure each customer receives the highest quality product every week. Our core product is the cooking experience we help our customers create. Central to these experiences are the original recipes we design and send along with fresh, seasonal ingredients directly to our customers. We also sell wine, which can be paired with our meals, and kitchen tools and staples we use in our test kitchens where we create new recipes. Our customers often cook with us multiple times each week, and they trust us to craft delicious recipes to feed their families and loved ones. We’re thrilled to be welcomed into our customers' homes and part of their weekly cooking routine!

### Coda
Coda started in 2014 with a simple observation: In a world full of pre-built tools and applications, why do documents and spreadsheets seem to run the world? The founding Coda team crossed paths at Google, YouTube, and Microsoft, where they saw their teams stretch the limits of what spreadsheets and documents can do. Then in 2014, they banded together to build the doc they always wanted. One that erased the boundaries between words and data. And where everyone could work together, in their own way, off the same data. Coda. It's a new day for docs. Learn more at https://coda.io.

After successfully launching and scaling Harry’s, Jeff and Andy saw an opportunity to bring their experience building Harry’s to other CPG categories where the consumer has also been historically underserved. Harry’s Inc. has grown significantly over the last ten years, and is now made up of five brands - Harry’s, Flamingo, Cat Person, Lume, Mando - and Harry’s Labs, the company’s incubation and M&A engine. The company employs more than 900 people across the U.S., U.K. and Germany, and is the largest CPG company built in the last 20 years. At Harry’s Inc, our mission is to Create Things People Like More — whether it's a product, an experience, or an internal tool, we believe in making the things around us better for our customers, and our team. Our mission extends beyond customers and team, to the community broadly. We believe that the best business models make a positive impact. So, we set aside 1% of sales across Harry’s, Flamingo, Cat Person, and Lume to support our social mission, including through donations to our nonprofit partners. At the end of the day, the key to our success is our amazing people. From chemists, mechanical engineers, CX associates, to creative directors, sourcing managers, and logistics specialists, the Harry’s team is composed of some of the most brilliant, diverse, and humble people you’ll ever meet. Our company is a place of inclusion, innovation, and deeply ingrained values.

### Hinge
Hinge is the dating app designed to be deleted. In today’s digital world, singles are so focused on sending likes and looking through profiles that they’re not actually building meaningful connections and going on dates. Hinge is on a mission to change that by designing the most effective app experience. On Hinge, there are no rules, timers, or games. Instead, you’ll have unique conversations over the text, photos, and audio you’ve shared on your profile. And it’s resonating with daters. Hinge was the fastest-growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada and Australia in 2019 and 2020.
